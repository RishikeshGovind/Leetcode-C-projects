# Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

# Example:
# Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

# Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if(n == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int currentConsecutiveSequence = 1;
        int longestConsecutiveSequence = 0;
        for(int i=1; i<n; i++){
            if(nums[i] != nums[i-1]){
                if(nums[i] == nums[i-1] + 1){
                    currentConsecutiveSequence++;
                }
                else{
                    longestConsecutiveSequence = max(longestConsecutiveSequence, currentConsecutiveSequence);
                    currentConsecutiveSequence = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return max(longestConsecutiveSequence, currentConsecutiveSequence);
    }
