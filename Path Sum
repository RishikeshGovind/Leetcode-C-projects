# Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.
# A leaf is a node with no children.

# Example:
# Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
# Output: true
# Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

# Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        if(!root)return false;                                         //Terminating Condition
        sum=sum-root->val;                                             //Body
        if(sum==0&&!root->left&&!root->right)return true;              //body
        return hasPathSum(root->left,sum)||hasPathSum(root->right,sum);//Propagation
    }
};
