# Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

# A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

# Example:
# Input: s = "Hello World"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

# Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) { 
        int len = 0, tail = s.length() - 1;
        while (tail >= 0 && s[tail] == ' ') tail--;
        while (tail >= 0 && s[tail] != ' ') {
            len++;
            tail--;
        }
        return len;
    }
};
