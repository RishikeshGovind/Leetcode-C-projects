# Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

# Example:
# Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
# Output: [1,2,5]

# Solution:
class Solution
{
public:
    ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head)
    {
        if(!head)
            return head;

                if(!prev) // This condition means element at the head is repeating. So, head pointer needs to be shifted.
